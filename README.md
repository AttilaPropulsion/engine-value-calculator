Created by SEDS Turkey Attila Propulsion team to calculate the optimum values for our engine faster and more reliably.

Credits to the team and especially to Bartu Bi≈ügin(https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartu-bisgin-49a7b012a/) who demonstrated and coded all the necessary equations and processes.

More modifications and improvements will be done in the process. 

Any collaboration and contribution will be appreciated.
