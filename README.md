Created by SEDS Turkey Attila Propulsion team to be able to calculate the desired values for our engine faster and more reliably.

Credits to all team and especially to Bartu Bi≈ügin(https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartu-bisgin-49a7b012a/) who demonstrated and coded all the necessary equations and processes.

More modifications and improvements will be done in the process. 

Any collaboration and contribution will be appreciated.
